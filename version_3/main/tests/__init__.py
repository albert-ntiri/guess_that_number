Package: unit_tests

Description: The unit_tests package contains all of the unit tests for the app.  It uses pytest to
    design the tests.  To run the tests, use "pytest -v tests" from the command line.  If any tests
    fail, "pytest -vv tests" will provide full detail of the differences for the failing tests.
